# Py - Sharp

This is a project to test out embedding Python3 with its cool libraries into .NET applications.


## Main goals
   - In-process solution to run python code inside .net application
   - Define a CSharp Class, instantiate from python, and bring back to main Program
   - Allow the use of libraries like numpy and scipy

## Pre-requisites
- dotnet-sdk
- Python 3.4 and above


## Usage
   **Note this is a prototype and thus does not really have a place to start outside of the code.**

   UPDATE `SCRIPTPATH` to path of your python script.
   UPDATE `PYBINPATH` to the path of your python binary. Dll for Windows, .so for most unix, and .dylib for macos (I think) 
   UPDATE `PYTHONVARNAME` to the name of the variable you would like to get from the python script.
      For example: if your script has a var `test_var` then `PYTHONVARNAME = "test_var";` 
 
   To run it:
   ```
    dotnet run
   ```
## Libraries

 ### .NET 
   - pythonnet
   - python
 ### Python
   - pythonnet

## TODO
 - [ ] Get it working with virtual env
 - [ ] Try on more complex py script
 - [ ] Try inside a ASP.NET application
